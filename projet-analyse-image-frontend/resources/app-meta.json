    "version": "2.1.0",
    "date": "2026-02-26",
    "summary": [
      "**Auto-backup system**: New backup scheduler (`backupService.js`) reads auto-backup settings from the Settings page and creates a timestamped SQLite snapshot on app start when the configured interval (daily/weekly) has elapsed.",
      "**Database Manager — backup UI**: \"Automatic Backups\" section with Create Backup Now button, backup list table (filename, date, size), and Restore button with confirmation modal.",
      "**Inline backup feedback**: Success/error message appears directly in the backup section after clicking Create Backup Now, without requiring scroll-to-top.",
      "**ProjectDetails — Zone separation**: Project Metadata (Zone A) and Project Workspace (Zone B) are now visually separated by distinct background fills (neutral gray vs. bioluminescent tint) instead of border lines.",
      "**ProjectDetails — Read-only greying**: Project Information, Time Tracking, and Description sections are dimmed (`opacity-60`) in view mode to communicate that they require Edit Project to modify. Folder & Structure action buttons remain at full opacity at all times.",
      "**ProjectDetails — removed border**: Outer border lines on Zone A and Zone B replaced by fill-based visual separation, consistent with the rest of the app's card style."
