# BIOME v1.3.1

Release date: 2025-11-06

## Changed
- Project list: selected project title now renders in cyan for stronger visual consistency with the table.
- Output/result pictograms unified across list and table; 24px standard size retained.

## Fixed
- In Projects Table, the Output icon on the active row now turns cyan (icon + circular border) like the rest of the row.
- Removed the inner table scrollbar; only the page scrollbar remains, so the table extends to the bottom naturally.
- Resolved double tooltip on the Output icon (removed native title attribute; kept custom tooltip).
