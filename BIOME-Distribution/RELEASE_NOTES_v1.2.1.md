# BIOME v1.2.1

Bugfix release.

## Fixed
- Project list could truncate before the window bottom on some sizes. The list now stretches correctly and only shows the bottom scroll hint when it actually overflows.

## Changed
- Scroll hint capsules restyled with the bioluminescent palette for better prominence and visual consistency with Activity Feed chips.

## Installer
- MSI: `BIOME_1.2.1_x64_en-US.msi`
- SHA256: `000C1A529BB1737FA35269A147B29A42301ADF29B0D9BACB85C833869B31D907`

## Notes
- No database changes.
- Desktop and web behavior consistent; environment detection unchanged.
