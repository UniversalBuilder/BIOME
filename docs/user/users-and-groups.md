# Users & Groups

BIOME lets you model your imaging facility's organizational structure using **Groups** (imaging core units or labs) and **Users** (individual researchers).

---

## Groups

A group typically represents an imaging core, a lab, or a department.

### Creating a Group

1. Go to **Users & Groups**
2. Click **+ New Group**
3. Enter a group name and optional description
4. Click **Create**

### Editing or Deleting a Group

- Click the **pencil icon** next to a group name to edit it
- Click the **trash icon** to delete (only possible if the group has no members)

---

## Users (Researchers)

Users represent individual researchers who submit projects or use your facility.

### Creating a User

1. Select a group in the left panel
2. Click **+ New User** (disabled until a group is selected)
3. Fill in name, email, and optional role
4. Click **Create**

### Editing or Deleting a User

- Click the **pencil icon** next to a user's name to edit
- Click the **trash icon** to remove from the group

## Linking Projects to Users

When creating or editing a project, you can assign a **PI (Principal Investigator)** from the registered users list. This allows BIOME to display researcher-level statistics in the Analytics section.

## Tips

- Create groups before users — the **+ New User** button is disabled until a group is selected
- Group names appear throughout the app wherever affiliation is displayed
- Deleting a user does not delete their projects — the PI field on those projects will show the original name as a plain string
