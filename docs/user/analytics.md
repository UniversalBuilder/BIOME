# Analytics

The Analytics page gives you a facility-wide view of your project portfolio through charts, statistics, and activity tracking.

---

## Overview Statistics

At the top of the page you will find summary cards:

| Card | Description |
|---|---|
| **Total Projects** | All projects in the database |
| **Active Projects** | Projects currently in progress |
| **Completed** | Successfully delivered projects |
| **Users** | Total registered researchers |

---

## Charts

### Projects by Status

A pie or bar chart breakdown of all projects grouped by their current status. Useful for identifying bottlenecks (e.g., many projects stuck in "Review").

### Projects Over Time

A timeline chart showing when projects were created. Helps visualise seasonal demand patterns and facility growth.

### Projects by Group

A breakdown of project counts per research group. Useful for reporting facility usage to stakeholders.

### Image Types Distribution

Shows how often each imaging modality (confocal, STED, TIRF, etc.) appears across projects.

## Activity Feed

The **Activity Feed** on the Dashboard and Analytics pages shows the most recent changes across all projects — creation, edits, and status transitions.

- Use **Show more** to paginate through older activity
- Each entry includes a timestamp, project name, and the type of change

---

## Exporting Data

From the **Table View** (`/table`), you can **Export to CSV** — this downloads a spreadsheet of all project records, which can be imported into Excel or any BI tool for additional analysis.

## Tips

- Keep project statuses up-to-date for accurate analytics
- Use consistent image type names (case-sensitive) for clean chart groupings
- The Table View export is the best way to build custom reports outside BIOME
