# BIOME v1.0 - UI/UX Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Debug Console Showing Incorrect Missing Files Status ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Debug console showed "Server.js: ‚ùå Missing" and "Bundled Node.js: ‚ùå Missing" despite the application working correctly.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed path validation logic in `main.rs` `get_debug_info` function
- Updated Node.js detection for production builds to be more accurate
- Production builds now properly check for system Node.js first, then fall back to bundled Node.js
- Added better error handling for production environment file detection

**Files Modified**:
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Updated `get_debug_info` function

### 2. Removed Unprofessional Emojis from Interface ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Debug console and settings interface used emojis (üîß, ‚öôÔ∏è) which appeared unprofessional.

**Solution**:
- Replaced emoji icons with professional SVG icons
- Updated Settings tab title to use gear SVG icon instead of emoji
- Updated Development Tools section to use settings SVG icon instead of wrench emoji

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/SettingsTab.js` - Replaced üîß with SVG icon
- `src/components/Layout.js` - Replaced ‚öôÔ∏è with SVG icon

### 3. Fixed Table View Refresh Button ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Table refresh button only refreshed data but didn't clear applied filters, causing confusion when filters remained active.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced refresh functionality to clear all filters before refreshing data
- Added separate "Clear Filters" button for better user control
- Updated refresh button tooltip to indicate it clears filters
- Improved user experience with distinct actions for different needs

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ProjectTableView.js` - Enhanced refresh and filter functionality

### 4. Fixed Demo Data Consistency ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Demo database showed projects with multiple software selections (e.g., "Imaris, FIJI/ImageJ") but the UI only allowed single software selection from dropdown.

**Solution**:
- Updated all demo projects to use single software selections
- Ensured consistency between demo data and UI capabilities
- Distributed software selections across different projects for realistic variety:
  - **Imaris**: 3D Neuronal Network, Mitochondrial Dynamics
  - **Fiji**: Live Cell Calcium, Fluorescence Quantification, Tumor Microenvironment
  - **CellProfiler**: Cell Counting Pipeline, Drug Screening
  - **QuPath**: Tissue Classification, IHC Quantification

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/database/demo-data.js` - Updated demo project software selections
- `src-tauri/resources/backend/src/database/demo-data.js` - Updated demo project software selections
