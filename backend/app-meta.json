    "version": "2.2.0",
    "date": "2026-02-26",
    "summary": [
      "**Demo Data mode**: New \"Load Demo Data\" button in the Database page. Populates the database with 10 realistic bioimage analysis projects, 6 researchers across 3 imaging core groups, and ~20 journal entries. A safety backup is created automatically before loading if the database already contains data.",
      "**Empty database on first launch**: BIOME now starts completely empty on first run and after Reset. Demo content is opt-in via the explicit \"Load Demo Data\" button — real user data is never silently overwritten by application updates or resets.",
      "**Backup date display**: All backups in the list were showing the same \"Created\" timestamp (the filesystem `mtime`). Dates are now parsed directly from the filename (`database-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.sqlite`), showing the correct individual creation time for each backup.",
      "**Delete Project modal positioning**: The confirmation dialog now uses a React Portal and renders at true viewport center, regardless of scroll position or parent transform context.",
      "**WizardFormModal**: All modals now use a React Portal (`z-[9999]`) ensuring correct stacking and centering in all scroll contexts. Added `variant=\"danger\"` prop for destructive-action modals (red button + warning icon in title).",
      "**Project creation wizard**: Background changed from a heavy blue gradient to a neutral `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-night-900`. Main card now uses the standard app card style (`night-800` border, `shadow-sm`) instead of a blurred glass effect."
